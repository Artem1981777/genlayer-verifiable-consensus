# GenLayer Verifiable Consensus

Interactive multi-contract dApp on GenLayer Testnet Bradbury: a thin browser client that submits real inputs to three deployed Intelligent Contracts (content moderation, prediction market, multi-source price oracle) and reads their on-chain state. Every consensus-critical decision — moderation verdicts, market outcomes, oracle medians — is computed and stored on-chain by the contracts; the frontend never decides anything.

## TL;DR

Three Intelligent Contracts run on GenLayer Testnet Bradbury, each deciding something that
needs *judgment*, not deterministic code:

- **Content Moderator** — validators reason over a natural-language policy and produce an
  on-chain APPROVE / FLAG / REMOVE verdict with category, confidence and rationale.
- **Prediction Market (v2)** — resolves YES / NO / UNRESOLVED from **immutable,
  binding-verified** web sources, with staking, a mandatory dispute window, settlement
  and payouts. The lifecycle is **fully permissionless** and every market carries a hard
  `final_deadline` exit, so funds can never stay locked.
- **Multi-Source Oracle** — median-consensus BTC/USD from Coinbase, CoinGecko and Kraken
  with tolerance and max-spread guards.

The dApp connects an EIP-6963 wallet, submits real write transactions, awaits accepted
receipts, and reads results. The frontend only submits inputs and reads state.

## Why GenLayer / Intelligent Contracts

Moderation verdicts, market resolutions and price aggregation cannot be computed by
deterministic code: they require natural-language reasoning over policies, web evidence
and numeric data. GenLayer's **Optimistic Democracy** runs a leader proposal through
validator review; the **Equivalence Principle** requires validators to independently
reach the same *decision* (not the same wording) for a transaction to be accepted. If
consensus is not reached, the transaction is UNDETERMINED and state does not change.

```

The boundary is strict: the frontend builds transactions (`writeContract`) and reads state
(`readContract` / `get_state`); all verdicts, outcomes, dispute resolutions and median
prices are computed inside the Intelligent Contracts under validator consensus.

## Features per contract

### Content Moderator — [`apps/content-moderator/contracts/moderator.py`](apps/content-moderator/contracts/moderator.py)

Purpose: decide whether user content complies with a natural-language community policy.

| Method | Type | Caller | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__init__(rules, content, item_id, source, author)` | deploy | — | stores rules, content, SHA-256 content hash; status `pending` |
| `moderate()` | write | anyone | runs the equivalence-principle verdict; status `pending → moderated` |
| `enforce()` | write | creator only | applies the verdict (REMOVE blocks content, FLAG limits it); `moderated → enforced` |
| `appeal(note)` | write | content author only | opens an appeal on a FLAG/REMOVE enforcement; max 2 appeals; `enforced → appealed` |
| `resolve_appeal()` | write | creator only | re-runs the verdict with the appeal note; `appealed → resolved`, outcome OVERTURNED/UPHELD |
| `set_content(content, item_id, source)` | write | creator only | replaces content before moderation |
| `get_state()` | view | — | full case state incl. verdict, category, confidence, history |
| `read_content()` | view | — | content, or a removal placeholder when blocked |
| `verify_content(content)` | view | — | SHA-256 check against the stored hash |

Invariants: only the creator enforces/resolves; only the author appeals; appeals limited
to 2; verdict must be one of APPROVE/FLAG/REMOVE; confidence clamped to 0..100.

### Prediction Market v2 — [`apps/prediction-market/contracts/prediction_market.py`](apps/prediction-market/contracts/prediction_market.py)

Purpose: resolve a yes/no question from **immutable, binding-verified** web sources with
staking, disputes, permissionless settlement and a hard deadline exit.

Steward-review hardening (v2):

1. **No creator authority in the lifecycle.** `resolve`, `resolve_dispute`, `settle`,
   `void`, `finalize` have no sender checks — any account drives them when the phase
   gates pass. Trading is bounded by `staking_deadline`; after `final_deadline`,
   `finalize()` (permissionless) always finishes the market: it settles when a definite
   outcome survived its dispute window, otherwise voids with 1:1 refunds. Funds can
   never stay locked.
2. **Sources immutable from birth, independent and semantically bound.** No
   `add_source` exists; the constructor fixes the source set (≥ 2 sources from ≥ 2
   different registrable domains, deterministic check) and hash-freezes the whole
   config. Each source carries a **binding excerpt** — a verbatim quote anchoring it to
   the question. During resolution every node re-fetches the source and deterministically
   verifies the excerpt appears verbatim (whitespace-normalized) in the rendered page;
   sources failing the check are excluded from evidence. The model never decides
   admissibility; the deterministic check does, identically on every node.

| Method | Type | Caller | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__init__(question, rules, source1..3, binding1..3, market_id, dispute_window_seconds, staking_deadline, final_deadline)` | deploy | — | validates + freezes config at birth (≥2 sources, ≥2 domains, binding excerpts, future deadlines); status `open` |
| `stake(side)` | **write, payable** | anyone | records the tx value on the chosen side, while `now < staking_deadline` |
| `resolve()` | write | **anyone** | after `staking_deadline` with ≥1 staker; comparative-consensus over binding-verified evidence; YES/NO opens a mandatory dispute window; UNRESOLVED stays open (retryable) |
| `dispute(reason)` | write | stakers only | contests the outcome while the window is open; max 2 rounds |
| `resolve_dispute()` | write | **anyone** | re-resolves with the dispute note; records UPHELD/OVERTURNED; opens a fresh window |
| `settle()` | write | **anyone** | after the window; pari-mutuel pools; auto-voids if the winning side is empty |
| `finalize()` | write | **anyone** | after `final_deadline`: settle-or-void hard exit (`deadline_void` opens 1:1 refunds) |
| `void()` | write | **anyone** | voids an unresolved market (never one with a definite YES/NO); refunds open |
| `claim()` | write | stakers only | single-use pari-mutuel payout on a settled market |
| `refund()` | write | stakers only | single-use 1:1 refund on a voided market |
| `get_state()` | view | — | full market state incl. pools, positions, claims, both deadlines, bindings, history |
| `verify_question(q)` / `verify_rules(r)` | view | — | SHA-256 checks |

Invariants: `stake` requires `value > 0` and exactly one `side` (YES/NO); settlement is
impossible while the dispute window is open; claims/refunds are single-use
(anti-double-spend); payouts use `emit_transfer(value=u256(...), on="finalized")`;
chain time is read via `genlayer._internal.msg.message_raw["datetime"]` with pure
string parsing (no datetime module) — identical on every node.

### Multi-Source Oracle — [`apps/multi-source-oracle/contracts/oracle.py`](apps/multi-source-oracle/contracts/oracle.py)

Purpose: publish a median price from multiple independent web sources with spread guards.

| Method | Type | Caller | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__init__()` | deploy | — | owner = deployer |
| `register_feed(key, question, sources_json, tolerance_bps, max_spread_bps, decimals)` | write | owner only | configures a feed (≥ 2 http(s) sources) |
| `remove_feed(key)` | write | owner only | deletes a feed and its value |
| `update(key)` | write | anyone | fetches all sources, median-consensus with tolerance + max-spread guard; publishes value + provenance |
| `get_state()` | view | — | feeds, values, history |
| `get(key)` / `get_value(key)` / `get_feed(key)` / `list_feeds()` | view | — | feed/value reads |
| `is_stale(key, max_age_rounds)` | view | — | staleness check |

Invariants: publication requires ≥ 2 usable sources and a spread ≤ `max_spread_bps`;
the validator must independently re-derive the **exact same outcome** (ok, median,
spread, count, decimals) from its own fetches — there is no tolerance band on the
median; `tolerance_bps` only bounds per-source liveness corroboration between the
leader's and validator's fetches. On guard failure the update is rejected and state
does not change. The live `btc_usd` feed uses Coinbase, CoinGecko and Kraken with
tolerance 100 bps and max spread 500 bps.

## Consensus design

### Content Moderator — `moderate()` / `resolve_appeal()`

- Pattern: **comparative equivalence** (`gl.eq_principle.prompt_comparative`).
- Leader: runs the moderation prompt (with an escalation pass when confidence < 70),
  returns compact JSON `{verdict, reason, category, confidence, escalated, needs_review}`.
- Validator comparison: the final `verdict` (APPROVE/FLAG/REMOVE) must match exactly.
  Confidence, category, reason wording and escalation are explicitly ignored — only the
  decision is compared.
- Unparseable output defaults to FLAG (human review), never to APPROVE.
- On UNDETERMINED: the transaction does not finalize and the case stays `pending` (or
  `appealed`); the UI shows the failure with the tx hash.

### Prediction Market v2 — `resolve()` / `resolve_dispute()`

- Pattern: **comparative equivalence** (`gl.eq_principle.prompt_comparative`) over
  **deterministically admissibilized evidence**.
- Leader: fetches each source via `gl.nondet.web.render(url, mode="text")`, verifies the
  source's **binding excerpt** verbatim (whitespace-normalized substring check — pure
  string logic, no tolerance), includes only verified sources as ADMISSIBLE evidence and
  marks the rest EXCLUDED, then extracts `{outcome: YES|NO|UNRESOLVED}` via
  `gl.nondet.exec_prompt`.
- Validator comparison: the final `outcome` must match exactly; wording, source text and
  which sources loaded are ignored — but each node applies the SAME deterministic
  binding check, so a source whose excerpt does not appear in the page is excluded from
  evidence on every node alike. The model never decides admissibility.
- On UNDETERMINED: state does not change; the market stays `open` (or `disputed`).

### Multi-Source Oracle — `update(key)`

- Pattern: **custom non-deterministic block** (`gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe(leader_fn, validator_fn)`).
- Leader: fetches every source (`gl.nondet.web.get` via the module-level
  `_fetch_provenance` helper), extracts the number, derives the full outcome —
  `ok`, `median_units`, `spread_bps`, `sources_used`, `decimals`, `provenance` —
  deterministically (`_derive_result`).
- Validator: first checks `isinstance(leader_result, gl.vm.Return)`; re-derives the
  outcome from the leader's provenance (claims must be bound to evidence); then
  **independently re-fetches all sources** and re-derives its own outcome, requiring
  **exact equality on every field** — no tolerance band on the median. Per-source
  liveness corroboration within `tolerance_bps` can only reject, never widen the
  accepted set. Nothing is published from leader-supplied data alone.
- Guards: `ok = (n >= 2) and (spread_bps <= max_spread_bps)`; on failure the update is
  rejected (`assert canon.ok`) and state does not change.

All `gl.nondet.*` calls occur strictly inside equivalence-principle functions or the
`run_nondet_unsafe` leader/validator pair — never in deterministic contract code.

## Transaction lifecycle

Every write action follows one path ([`src/lib/genlayer.ts`](src/lib/genlayer.ts)):

```
writeContract({ address, functionName, args, value })
        │
        ▼
await waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash, status: ACCEPTED, interval: 3000, retries: 8 })
        │  (direct RPC read client — never the wallet provider)
        ▼
classifyExecution(txExecutionResultName)
        │
        ├── FINISHED / FINISHED_WITH_RETURN  → success → re-read get_state
        ├── PENDING (transport-only, no consensus answer) → UI keeps hash, keeps polling
        └── anything else (FINISHED_WITH_ERROR, NOT_VOTED, UNDETERMINED,
            LEADER_TIMEOUT, …) → FAILURE → error surfaced in UI, tx hash preserved
```

Status interpretation in the UI:

| Status | Meaning | UI treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PENDING / PROPOSING / COMMITTING / REVEALING | in flight | "submitted · finalizing on-chain", auto re-poll |
| ACCEPTED | consensus reached (fast path) | success only if the execution result is FINISHED/FINISHED_WITH_RETURN |
| FINALIZED | final | same execution-result gate |
| UNDETERMINED | no consensus | failure; state not changed |
| CANCELED / LEADER_TIMEOUT | aborted | failure |

The strict allowlist lives in `SUCCESS_RESULTS` / `classifyExecution`
([`src/lib/genlayer.ts`](src/lib/genlayer.ts)) and is unit-tested in
[`src/lib/genlayer.test.ts`](src/lib/genlayer.test.ts).

## Quick start

Requirements: Node ≥ 18, npm, a browser with an EIP-6963 wallet (MetaMask).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Artem1981777/genlayer-verifiable-consensus.git
cd genlayer-verifiable-consensus
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, connect your wallet, switch to GenLayer Testnet Bradbury
(chain id `0x107d`), and interact with the seeded contracts. Testnet GEN is available
from the faucet: <https://testnet-faucet.genlayer.foundation/>

## Deploy

Contracts are deployed with the GenLayer CLI against Testnet Bradbury:

```bash
npm install -g genlayer
genlayer network testnet-bradbury        # or: genlayer network set

# Content Moderator
genlayer deploy --contract apps/content-moderator/contracts/moderator.py \
  --args '["<rules>", "<content>", "<item_id>", "<source>", "<author>"]'

# Prediction Market v2
genlayer deploy --contract apps/prediction-market/contracts/prediction_market.py \
  --args '["<question>", "<rules>", "<source1..3>", "<binding1..3>", "<market_id>", <dispute_window_seconds>, <staking_deadline>, <final_deadline>]'

# Multi-Source Oracle
genlayer deploy --contract apps/multi-source-oracle/contracts/oracle.py
```

Alternatively, the repo's Node deploy scripts (`apps/*/deploy.mjs`) deploy via
`genlayer-js` and print the resulting address.

After deploying, update the tracked addresses in
[`src/lib/projects.ts`](src/lib/projects.ts) (`seedContracts`) and rebuild:

```bash
npm run build   # static export to out/
```

The live site is served from the `gh-pages` branch (GitHub Pages).

## Testing

```bash
npm test                        # 91/91 unit tests (vitest, no mocks)
npx tsc --noEmit                # typecheck
npm run build                   # production build
node tests/smoke.onchain.mjs    # live get_state reads from all three deployed contracts
node tests/probe-reads.mjs      # diagnostic: read each contract with retries
```

Unit coverage ([`src/lib/actions.test.ts`](src/lib/actions.test.ts),
[`src/lib/genlayer.test.ts`](src/lib/genlayer.test.ts)):

| Area | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| `classifyExecution` | success (FINISHED, FINISHED_WITH_RETURN), failure (FINISHED_WITH_ERROR, NOT_VOTED, UNDETERMINED, LEADER_TIMEOUT), pending |
| `parseStakeWei` | rejects empty, zero, negative, fractional, non-numeric; accepts positive integers |
| `stake.validate` / `stake.value` | side must be YES/NO; amount must be a positive integer before the wallet opens |
| Action visibility matrix | phase (open/dispute_window/disputed/dispute_resolved/settled/voided), per-caller claim/dispute/settle/refund gating, dispute-window open/closed boundary, 2-round dispute limit, permissionless resolve/settle/resolve_dispute/void, staking/final deadline gates, finalize visibility, void gating |
| Live reads | `get_state` from deployed Content Moderator and Prediction Market contracts |

On-chain test suites for the market contract (need a funded key):

- Deterministic, no LLM: `apps/prediction-market/test-payable.mjs` — 20/20 PASS
  (`test-payable-results.txt`), including `finalize()` executed by a **non-creator**
  account → `deadline_void` → 1:1 refunds, late-stake reverts and creation-validation
  rejections (single domain, missing binding).
- Full AI lifecycle: `apps/prediction-market/test.mjs` — 19/19 consolidated
  (`test-results.txt`): stake → **stranger** resolve (binding-verified YES) → mandatory
  dispute window → dispute → **stranger** resolve_dispute → **stranger** settle → claim
  1:1 → double-claim revert; recovery market auto-void (`winning_side_empty`) → refund;
  gating reverts.
- Offline consensus simulation: `apps/prediction-market/sim_market.py` — 54/54 checks
  (permissionless flows, deadline exit, binding verification incl. tamper/divergence
  rejection, domain independence, gating) with a deterministic mock of the `genlayer`
  runtime driving the REAL contract source.
- Deploy parity: `apps/prediction-market/verify.mjs` — sha256 proof that the deployed
  code is byte-for-byte identical to `contracts/prediction_market.py`
  (`parity-proof.txt`).

## Usage walkthrough

### 1. Content moderation: moderate → enforce → appeal → resolve_appeal

1. Open the live app, connect a wallet, pick the Content Moderator project and the
   seeded case (`0x235F…24F9`).
2. Press **Moderate** — a write tx runs the equivalence-principle verdict (~1–2 min of
   AI consensus). Example on-chain result: verdict REMOVE, category other, confidence 100
   ([tx](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/tx/0x2dfc598349349a8cc69cf774ff8c07d95bfc9de3399a9a75f9faea022fc0f06c)).
3. The creator presses **Enforce** — content is blocked on-chain
   ([tx](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/tx/0x50cd96099418f555d91b4e4d27288902940a1b7793780bb96a50dc434cb5bde4)).
4. The content author presses **Appeal** with a note
   ([tx](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/tx/0x8578d3e39d485c106d7e33ea35aa74793b441545ca9be70f09a4227219652e79)).
5. The creator presses **Resolve appeal** — validators re-run the verdict with the appeal
   note; outcome UPHELD or OVERTURNED
   ([tx](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/tx/0x14fa4e5b4bfdd1eb488c31b2894391d5f65d2459e806112133f51c047e4513c5)).

### 2. Prediction market: stake → resolve → dispute → settle → claim

1. Pick the Prediction Market project (showcase `0x2dc0…A6BE`, open with live staking; or the settled lifecycle proof `0x390C…8ba0`).
2. **Stake**: choose YES or NO and a whole positive wei amount; the UI rejects zero or
    fractional amounts before the wallet opens. The stake is the transaction value —
    `stake(side)` takes exactly one argument; trading is bounded by the on-chain
    `staking_deadline` (countdown in the UI). Sources and config were already
    hash-frozen at creation.
 3. **Anyone** (not just the creator) presses **Resolve** once the staking deadline has
    passed — every node re-fetches each source, verifies its binding excerpt verbatim
    and only then admits it as evidence; validators reach a comparative-consensus
    outcome, and a YES/NO outcome opens the mandatory dispute window (live countdown in
    the UI). On the lifecycle proof market the resolve was executed by a non-creator
    account and returned YES from binding-verified evidence.
 4. Any staker can **Dispute** with a reason while the window is open (max 2 rounds);
    **anyone** then **Resolve dispute**, which opens a fresh window.
 5. After the window closes **anyone** presses **Settle**; if nobody backed the winning
    side the market auto-voids and refunds open. After the `final_deadline` anyone can
    always **Finalize** the market (settle-or-void) — the permissionless hard exit that
    makes locked funds impossible.
 6. Winners press **Claim** for a pari-mutuel payout; on a voided market stakers press
    **Refund** for a 1:1 return.

### 3. Oracle: update(key)

1. Pick the Multi-Source Oracle project (`0x2Ab5…2C82`).
2. Press **Update feed** with key `btc_usd` — validators independently fetch Coinbase,
   CoinGecko and Kraken, corroborate values within tolerance, and publish the median with
   provenance and spread
   ([tx](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/tx/0x5c3f94b50f9dc8c705f12bec8b5d37fffc3e0ef379eb44b2402c366cf2258c72) —
   FINALIZED, 3 sources, spread 2 bps).
3. The panel shows the published median, samples, provenance and spread from `get_state`.

## Evidence & verification

Full evidence pack with per-action transactions: [`docs/EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EVIDENCE.md).
Steward review response: [`docs/REVIEW-RESPONSE.md`](docs/REVIEW-RESPONSE.md).

Verify independently:

```bash
npm ci
npm test                          # 91/91
npx tsc --noEmit                  # clean
npm run build                     # passes
node tests/smoke.onchain.mjs      # live reads from all three contracts
```

Or read any contract directly (no wallet needed):

```js
import { createClient } from "genlayer-js"
import { testnetBradbury } from "genlayer-js/chains"
const client = createClient({ chain: testnetBradbury })
const state = await client.readContract({
  address: "0x2dc09cDbb8319303eAc78E85D5d055BB53bdA6BE",
  functionName: "get_state",
  args: [],
})
```

Note: `gen_getContractSchema` on Bradbury currently returns
`VMError: invalid_contract absent_runner_comment`, so machine-readable schemas cannot be
attached; parity is proven by committed sources plus the on-chain executions in the
evidence pack.

## Security & limitations

- **Testnet only.** All contracts and the dApp target GenLayer Testnet Bradbury; no
  mainnet deployment, no security audit.
- **UNDETERMINED risk.** If validators do not reach equivalence, the transaction is
  UNDETERMINED and state does not change; the UI reports it as a failure with the tx
  hash. AI actions occasionally need a retry on testnet.
- **LLM/web limits.** Moderation and market resolution depend on LLM reasoning and web
  fetches inside the validator sandbox; a dead source is ignored by design (moderation
  defaults to FLAG, market resolution to UNRESOLVED), and the oracle requires ≥ 2
  corroborated sources within tolerance.
- **Keys.** Private keys never leave the wallet; `.env.example` files document required
  variables for local scripts; no secrets are committed.
- **`genlayer schema` limitation.** `gen_getContractSchema` on Bradbury returns
  `VMError: invalid_contract absent_runner_comment`; parity is proven by sources + txs.
- **Escrow demo.** The `/escrow` route is a bonus demo (contract source embedded in
  `src/lib/escrow.ts`, deployed per-use from the browser) and is not part of the three
  claimed contracts.

## Roadmap

- Migrate the oracle feed set to configurable multi-asset feeds (ETH/USD, SOL/USD).
- Add a market-creation flow in the UI (currently markets are created via deploy scripts).
- On-chain appeal history graph in the analytics view.
- gltest integration suite against a local simulator once supported on Windows.
